# rfirr - Radio signal based irrigation system used with two Raspberry Pi computers

## Description

rfirr is an irrigation application which is installed on two Raspberry Pi computers. One of them is the main computer activating the second one that is controlling the actual irrigation system. Having a setup like this allows for the use of a small battery such as a power bank to power the second Pi. This in turn makes it possible to have the irrigation system in a place without additional power and controlling it from the main Pi that is inside a building within ~20 meters (depends on location and radio equipment signal strength)
